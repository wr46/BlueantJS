# BlueantJS

BlueAnt unofficially offers a rest service.
Our service provider does not give any support for it and won't garantee data consistency.

They instead recommend to use the soap service. However..

## How to use the rest service
The rest service has the same endpoints as the soap service (see [wsdl2html.html](https://git.sinnerschrader.com/blueant/BlueantJS/raw/master/wsdl2html.html))

For example you can call _https://{blueantHost}/services/BaseService/Login_ with username and password as get/post parameters.
As a result you will get a session key which you have to add to all other requests.
Your personally assigned projects can be requested with _https://{blueantHost}/services/WorktimeAccountingService/getProjects_ and only the 
sessionID as post parameter.

> But, dont use GET-Parameters for security reasons. You have to pass your arguments as form data

One thing to note: BlueAnt does not return json answers, but only XML.

### Test it

### Example Usage

#### Startup
If you build a javascript application you may be limited to the same origin policy.

You can easily create a proxy for blueant with express and express-http-proxy.

```javascript
app.use('/blueant', proxy('https://blueant-uat.sinnerschrader.com', {
    forwardPath: function (req, res) {
        var path = require('url').parse(req.url).path;
        return '/blueant' + path;
    }
}));
```

#### Login
```javascript
var blueant = new Blueant();
blueant.setEnviroment('http://localhost:3000/blueant');
blueant.login('username', 'password').then(() => { console.log('Login successfull'); });
```
Have a look at demo/app/login/login.component.ts

#### Worktimes
```javascript
var blueant = new Blueant();
blueant.setEnviroment('http://localhost:3000/blueant');
blueant.login('username', 'password').then(() => {
    console.log('Login successfull');
    blueant.getWorktime(new Date()).then(function (worktimes) {
        console.log(worktimes);
    });
});

```

#### Further examples
You can find many examples in the demo application.
Have a look at the components in demo/app/.

### Build
Any changes in the src-folder can be build with the following command:
